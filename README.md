## Project Description

In this project, I will write a dynamic table based upon an aliens sighting dataset. The filterable table will be visualized on a web page. 

## Features & Libraries
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* D3.js

## My Process

1. Create a basic HTML web page 
2. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting
  * Have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`
3. Add a date form in my HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input
4. Using multiple `input` tags and select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
